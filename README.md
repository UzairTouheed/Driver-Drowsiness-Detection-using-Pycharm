👁️ Driver Drowsiness Detection System
A real-time alert system designed to enhance road safety by detecting driver fatigue using:

MediaPipe Face Mesh for precise facial landmark detection.

Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to determine drowsiness in real time.

PyGame audio alerts and location tagging via IP-based geolocation.

Integrated with OpenCV for live webcam feed and smart visual overlays.

Optimized for performance and reliability, with suppressed background logs for a clean experience.

⚠️ Smart, responsive, and location-aware — built for practical deployment.
